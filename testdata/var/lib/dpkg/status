Description: Perl module with additional list functions not found in List::Util
 List::MoreUtils provides some trivial but commonly needed functionality on
 lists which is not going to go into List::Util.

 All of the functions are implementable in only a couple of lines of Perl
 code. Using the functions from this module however should give slightly better
 performance as everything is implemented in C. The pure-Perl implementation of
 these functions only serves as a fallback in case the C portions of this module
 could not be compiled on this machine.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

 GNU Make is a utility which controls the generation of executables

 files. It determines automatically which pieces of a large program
 need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create
 them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
 are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
 corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
 computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency
 solver.

 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.
 .
 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),
 Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny
 (libtry-tiny-perl).

 for building Debian packages.
 .
 This package contains an informational list of packages which are
 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also

 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.

 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all

Description: system and service manager - SysV links
 systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It provides aggressive
 parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting
 services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
 elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
 .
 systemd is compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts and can work as a
 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
 .
 This package provides the manual pages and links needed for systemd
 to replace sysvinit. Installing systemd-sysv will overwrite /sbin/init with a
 link to systemd.

Pre-Depends: libc6 (>= 2.11)
Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: IEEE 802.11 AP and IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticator
 Originally, hostapd was an optional user space component for Host AP
 driver. It adds more features to the basic IEEE 802.11 management
 included in the kernel driver: using external RADIUS authentication
 server for MAC address based access control, IEEE 802.1X Authenticator
 and dynamic WEP keying, RADIUS accounting, WPA/WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i/RSN)
 Authenticator and dynamic TKIP/CCMP keying.
 .
 The current version includes support for other drivers, an integrated
 EAP authenticator (i.e., allow full authentication without requiring
 an external RADIUS authentication server), and RADIUS authentication
 server for EAP authentication.
 .
 hostapd works with the following drivers:
 .
  * mac80211 based drivers with support for master mode [linux]
  * Host AP driver for Prism2/2.5/3 [linux]
  * Driver interface for FreeBSD net80211 layer [kfreebsd]
  * Any wired Ethernet driver for wired IEEE 802.1X authentication.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.

 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.

 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

Description: Linux entropy source using the HAVEGE algorithm
 haveged is a userspace entropy daemon which is not dependent upon the
 standard mechanisms for harvesting randomness for the system entropy
 pool. This is important in systems with high entropy needs or limited
 user interaction (e.g. headless servers).
 .
 haveged uses HAVEGE (HArdware Volatile Entropy Gathering and Expansion)
 to maintain a 1M pool of random bytes used to fill /dev/random
 whenever the supply of random bits in dev/random falls below the low
 water mark of the device.

Description: secure shell (SSH) server, for secure access from remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the sshd server.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 sshd replaces the insecure rshd program, which is obsolete for most
 purposes.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Description: system and service manager
 systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It provides aggressive
 parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting
 services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
 elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
 .
 systemd is compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts and can work as a
 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/bin/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

Description: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from

 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.15 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
 It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
 as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (library)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.
